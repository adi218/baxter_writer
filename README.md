# baxter_writer
Through this project we get Baxter to write just like we do. It recognizes the math equation written on a whiteboard. The digits in the equation placed
in front of it are recognized using deep learning and the answer is calculated based on the equation. Baxter then writes the answer to the problem on the whiteboard.
Important technologies used : Python, TensorFlow, ROS
